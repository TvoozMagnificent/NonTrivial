# Pressing World Problems [back](https://tvoozmagnificent.github.io/NonTrivial/nontrivial.html)

## Possible problems

> **Climate Change**, e.g. global warming

> **Artificial Intelligence**, e.g. misuse of it

> **Illiteracy**, e.g. the risk of getting scammed

> **Internet**, e.g. too much time wasting away

> **Mass destruction weapons**, e.g. nuclear bombs

## Importance, according to [multiple](https://www.un.org/en/global-issues) [given](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/) [online](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/) [resources](https://globalchallenges.org/global-risks/)

> **Climate Change** appears in **3** sources. 

> **Artificial Intelligence** appears in **2** sources. 

> ~~**Illiteracy** appears in **1** source.~~ 

> **Internet safety** appears in **2** sources. 

> **Mass destruction weapons** appears in all **4** sources. 

## Personal Edge

My personal edge is in technology-related fields, so I am better off dealing with **Internet Safety** or **Artificial Intelligence**.

## Problem Statements

> # Problem: Internet Safety
> > **Summary:** Internet safety is crucial in today's digital age, where the internet plays a significant role in daily life, from communication and education to entertainment and business. 
> 
> > **Why do you think this problem could be among the most important global problems for you to work:** This problem can be worked on in various different aspects, which means that we can pile on to existing efforts without worrying about diminishing returns. Additionally, this effort can positively affect a lot of people, since more than two thirds of the world population is a potential target. 

> # Problem: Artificial Intelligence
> > **Summary:** Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize many aspects of society, from healthcare and transportation to education and entertainment. However, its development and deployment come with several significant challenges and issues. 
> 
> > **Why do you think this problem could be among the most important global problems for you to work:** This is a new problem, which means there is less effort put into it. With the increasing popularity of AI, its dangers are more and more influential. 

> # Problem: Farm Animals
> > **Summary:** Farm animals play a critical role in agriculture and human society by providing food, fiber, labor, and other products. The care, management, and welfare of farm animals are essential to sustainable farming practices and have significant ethical, environmental, and economic implications.
> 
> > **Why do you think this problem could be among the most important global problems for you to work:** This effort can save a large population of animals with negligible cost. 

## Brainstorm some initial project ideas

My top problem is: Artificial Intelligence
