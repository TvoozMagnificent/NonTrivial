# Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality

## Chapter 1: A Day of Very Low Probability

> Now his parents were getting into one of those arguments again, one where his mother tried to make his father feel guilty, and his father tried to make his mother feel stupid.

```
The Experimental Method
```
> If it's true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor here and see the magic for ourselves, and Dad will admit that it's true. And if not, then Mum will admit that it's false. That's what the experimental method is for, so that we don't have to resolve things just by arguing.

The Experimental Method, instead of presenting arguments, tests the truth of a statement by experimentation, usully comparing a test group (made with alterations) to a control group (made with no alterations or a placebo). 

## Chapter 2: Everything I Believe Is False

> Nothing about how magic doesn't work when people are sceptical of it, or anything like that.

## Chapter 3: Comparing Reality To Its Alternatives

```
The Bystander Effect
```

> Latane and Darley's experiment had shown that you were more likely to get help if you had an epileptic fit in front of one person than in front of three. Diffusion of responsibility, everyone hoping that someone else would go first.

The Bystander Effect refers to the effect that, when there are bystanders nearby, the diffusion of responsibility means nobody will step in. 

## Chapter 4: The Efficient Market Hypothesis

> World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to call it world optimisation.

```
Fermi Estimation
```

> It's a mathematical thing. Named after Enrico Fermi. A way of getting rough numbers quickly in your head...
> 
> Twenty gold Galleons weighed a tenth of a kilogram, maybe? And gold was, what, ten thousand British pounds a kilogram? So a Galleon would be worth about fifty pounds... The mounds of gold coins looked to be about sixty coins high and twenty coins wide in either dimension of the base, and a mound was pyramidal, so it would be around one-third of the cube. Eight thousand Galleons per mound, roughly, and there were around five mounds of that size, so forty thousand Galleons or 2 million pounds sterling.

Fermi Estimation is a way to get rough numbers quickly by partitioning your estimation into steps. 

```
Logical vs. Emotion
```

> I cannot deny the sense of your words, though I much wish I could.

Sometimes, logic and emotion can go against each other. In such cases, we shall apply our rationale. 

## Chapter 5: The Fundamental Attribution Error

> Draco Malfoy said in front of his father that he wanted to be sorted into Gryffindor! Joking around isn't enough to do that!

```
Fundamental Attribution Error
```

> I suppose there's no chance that if I said fundamental attribution error you'd have any idea what that meant.

A fundamental attribution error is in which a permanent trait is given to a person due to one occurence that may also be (better) explained using circumstance or chance. 

## Chapter 6: The Planning Fallacy

> It doesn't carry the same weight as a replicated, peer-reviewed journal article about a controlled study with random assignment, many subjects, large effect sizes and strong statistical significance.

```
Planning Fallacies
```

> Muggle researchers have found that people are always very optimistic, compared to reality. Like they say something will take two days and it takes ten days, or they say it'll take two months and it takes over thirty-five years. For example, in one experiment, they asked students for times by which they were 50% sure, 75% sure, and 99% sure they'd complete their homework, and only 13%, 19%, and 45% of the students finished by those times. And they found that the reason was that when they asked one group for their best-case estimates if everything went as well as possible, and another group for their average-case estimates if everything went as usual, they got back answers that were statistically indistinguishable.

A planning fallacy occurs when people envision a best-case scenario as an average-case scenario. 

## Chapter 7: Reciprocation

> I ask the fundamental question of rationality: Why do you believe what you believe? What do you think you know and how do you think you know it?

```
The Fundamental Question of Rationality
```

The fundamental question of rationality is: 
1. Why do you think what you think? 
2. What do you think you think?
3. How do you think you know?

```
Reciprocation
```

> My own books called it reciprocation and they talk about how giving someone a straight gift of two Sickles was found to be twice as effective as offering them twenty Sickles in getting them to do what you want...

Reciprocation is a manipulative technique that opts for an unconditional gift first, then asking for what you want them to do. 

## Chapter 8: Positive Bias

```
Positive Bias
```

> "What you've just discovered is called 'positive bias'," said the boy. "You had a rule in your mind, and you kept on thinking of triplets that should make the rule say 'Yes'. But you didn't try to test any triplets that should make the rule say 'No'. In fact you didn't get a single 'No', so 'any three numbers' could have just as easily been the rule. It's sort of like how people imagine experiments that could confirm their hypotheses instead of trying to imagine experiments that could falsify them - that's not quite exactly the same mistake but it's close. You have to learn to look on the negative side of things, stare into the darkness. When this experiment is performed, only 20% of grownups get the answer right. And many of the others invent fantastically complicated hypotheses and put great confidence in their wrong answers since they've done so many experiments and everything came out like they expected."

Positive Bias is in which people just want to prove their hypothesis, but don't try to see if their hypothesis is easily disprovable. 

## Chapter 9: Title Redacted, Part I

> "Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."

## Chapter 10: Self Awareness, Part II

> "I seem to have become self-aware."

```
Self Awareness
```

> If you're placed on the head of anyone who so much as thinks about the question of whether the Sorting Hat is aware of its own awareness -

Self awareness is in which one is aware of itself, and aware of itself's consciousness. 

```
Morality
```

> You are perfectly capable of 'just letting it go', as you put it. Regardless of your verbal deliberations on morality, your nonverbal emotional core sees no dead body and no blood; as far as it is concerned, I am just a talking hat. And even though you tried to suppress the thought, your internal monitoring is perfectly aware that you didn't mean to do it, are spectacularly unlikely to ever do it again, and that the only real point of trying to stage a guilt fit is to cancel out your sense of transgression with a display of remorse. Can you just promise to keep this a secret and let us get on with it?

```
Trading Fullfillments of Utility Functions
```

> Defeating the Dark Lord is neither selfish nor short-term. All the parts of my mind are in accord on this: If you don't answer my questions, I'll refuse to talk to you, and you won't be able to do a good and proper Sorting.
>
> "I ought to put you in Slytherin for that!"
>
> But that is equally an empty threat. You cannot fulfill your own fundamental values by Sorting me falsely. So let us trade fulfillments of our utility functions.
