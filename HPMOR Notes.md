# Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality

## Chapter 1: A Day of Very Low Probability

> Now his parents were getting into one of those arguments again, one where his mother tried to make his father feel guilty, and his father tried to make his mother feel stupid.

```
The Experimental Method
```
> If it's true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor here and see the magic for ourselves, and Dad will admit that it's true. And if not, then Mum will admit that it's false. That's what the experimental method is for, so that we don't have to resolve things just by arguing.

The Experimental Method, instead of presenting arguments, tests the truth of a statement by experimentation, usully comparing a test group (made with alterations) to a control group (made with no alterations or a placebo). 

## Chapter 2: Everything I Believe Is False

> Nothing about how magic doesn't work when people are sceptical of it, or anything like that.

## Chapter 3: Comparing Reality To Its Alternatives

```
The Bystander Effect
```

> Latane and Darley's experiment had shown that you were more likely to get help if you had an epileptic fit in front of one person than in front of three. Diffusion of responsibility, everyone hoping that someone else would go first.

The Bystander Effect refers to the effect that, when there are bystanders nearby, the diffusion of responsibility means nobody will step in. 

## Chapter 4: The Efficient Market Hypothesis

> World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to call it world optimisation.

```
Fermi Estimation
```

> It's a mathematical thing. Named after Enrico Fermi. A way of getting rough numbers quickly in your head...
> 
> Twenty gold Galleons weighed a tenth of a kilogram, maybe? And gold was, what, ten thousand British pounds a kilogram? So a Galleon would be worth about fifty pounds... The mounds of gold coins looked to be about sixty coins high and twenty coins wide in either dimension of the base, and a mound was pyramidal, so it would be around one-third of the cube. Eight thousand Galleons per mound, roughly, and there were around five mounds of that size, so forty thousand Galleons or 2 million pounds sterling.

Fermi Estimation is a way to get rough numbers quickly by partitioning your estimation into steps. 

```
Logical vs. Emotion
```

> I cannot deny the sense of your words, though I much wish I could.

Sometimes, logic and emotion can go against each other. In such cases, we shall apply our rationale. 

## Chapter 5: The Fundamental Attribution Error

> Draco Malfoy said in front of his father that he wanted to be sorted into Gryffindor! Joking around isn't enough to do that!

```
Fundamental Attribution Error
```

> I suppose there's no chance that if I said fundamental attribution error you'd have any idea what that meant.

A fundamental attribution error is in which a permanent trait is given to a person due to one occurence that may also be (better) explained using circumstance or chance. 

## Chapter 6: The Planning Fallacy

> It doesn't carry the same weight as a replicated, peer-reviewed journal article about a controlled study with random assignment, many subjects, large effect sizes and strong statistical significance.

```
Planning Fallacies
```

> Muggle researchers have found that people are always very optimistic, compared to reality. Like they say something will take two days and it takes ten days, or they say it'll take two months and it takes over thirty-five years. For example, in one experiment, they asked students for times by which they were 50% sure, 75% sure, and 99% sure they'd complete their homework, and only 13%, 19%, and 45% of the students finished by those times. And they found that the reason was that when they asked one group for their best-case estimates if everything went as well as possible, and another group for their average-case estimates if everything went as usual, they got back answers that were statistically indistinguishable.

A planning fallacy occurs when people envision a best-case scenario as an average-case scenario. 

## Chapter 7: Reciprocation

> I ask the fundamental question of rationality: Why do you believe what you believe? What do you think you know and how do you think you know it?

```
The Fundamental Question of Rationality
```

The fundamental question of rationality is: 
1. Why do you think what you think? 
2. What do you think you think?
3. How do you think you know?

```
Reciprocation
```

> My own books called it reciprocation and they talk about how giving someone a straight gift of two Sickles was found to be twice as effective as offering them twenty Sickles in getting them to do what you want...

Reciprocation is a manipulative technique that opts for an unconditional gift first, then asking for what you want them to do. 

## Chapter 8: Positive Bias

```
Positive Bias
```

> "What you've just discovered is called 'positive bias'," said the boy. "You had a rule in your mind, and you kept on thinking of triplets that should make the rule say 'Yes'. But you didn't try to test any triplets that should make the rule say 'No'. In fact you didn't get a single 'No', so 'any three numbers' could have just as easily been the rule. It's sort of like how people imagine experiments that could confirm their hypotheses instead of trying to imagine experiments that could falsify them - that's not quite exactly the same mistake but it's close. You have to learn to look on the negative side of things, stare into the darkness. When this experiment is performed, only 20% of grownups get the answer right. And many of the others invent fantastically complicated hypotheses and put great confidence in their wrong answers since they've done so many experiments and everything came out like they expected."

Positive Bias is in which people just want to prove their hypothesis, but don't try to see if their hypothesis is easily disprovable. 

## Chapter 9: Title Redacted, Part I

> "Oh, dear. This has never happened before..."

## Chapter 10: Self Awareness, Part II

> "I seem to have become self-aware."

```
Self Awareness
```

> If you're placed on the head of anyone who so much as thinks about the question of whether the Sorting Hat is aware of its own awareness -

Self awareness is in which one is aware of itself, and aware of itself's consciousness. 

```
Morality
```

> You are perfectly capable of 'just letting it go', as you put it. Regardless of your verbal deliberations on morality, your nonverbal emotional core sees no dead body and no blood; as far as it is concerned, I am just a talking hat. And even though you tried to suppress the thought, your internal monitoring is perfectly aware that you didn't mean to do it, are spectacularly unlikely to ever do it again, and that the only real point of trying to stage a guilt fit is to cancel out your sense of transgression with a display of remorse. Can you just promise to keep this a secret and let us get on with it?

```
Trading Fullfillments of Utility Functions
```

> Defeating the Dark Lord is neither selfish nor short-term. All the parts of my mind are in accord on this: If you don't answer my questions, I'll refuse to talk to you, and you won't be able to do a good and proper Sorting.
>
> "I ought to put you in Slytherin for that!"
>
> But that is equally an empty threat. You cannot fulfill your own fundamental values by Sorting me falsely. So let us trade fulfillments of our utility functions.

## Chapter 11: Omake Files 1, 2, 3

## Chapter 12: Impulse Control

## Chapter 13: Asking the Wrong Questions

## Chapter 14: The Unknown and the Unknowable

```
Correlation vs. Causation
```

> SO THAT'S HOW THE COMED-TEA WORKS! Of course! The spell doesn't force funny events to happen, it just makes you feel an impulse to drink right before funny things are going to happen anyway! I'm such a fool, I should have realised when I felt the impulse to drink the Comed-Tea before Dumbledore's second speech, didn't drink it, and then choked on my own saliva instead - drinking the Comed-Tea doesn't cause the comedy, the comedy causes you to drink the Comed-Tea! I saw the two events were correlated and assumed the Comed-Tea had to be the cause and the comedy had to be the effect because I thought temporal order restrained causation and causal graphs had to be acyclic BUT IT ALL MAKES SENSE ONCE YOU DRAW THE CAUSAL ARROWS GOING BACKWARDS IN TIME!

Correlation does not always imply causation. The direction could be wrong, there could be a common cause, or it could be a coincidence. 

## Chapter 15: Conscientiousness

## Chapter 16: Lateral Thinking

## Chapter 17: Locating the Hypothesis

```
Priveleging the Hypothesis
```

> Harry had the feeling this conversation was not going to work out in his favour, but he carried on regardless. "No. I don't even know if that fallacy has an official name, but if I had to make one up myself, it would be 'privileging the hypothesis' or something like that. How can I put this formally... um... suppose you had a million boxes, and only one of the boxes contained a diamond. And you had a box full of diamond-detectors, and each diamond-detector always went off in the presence of a diamond, and went off half the time on boxes that didn't have a diamond. If you ran twenty detectors over all the boxes, you'd have, on average, one false candidate and one true candidate left. And then it would just take one or two more detectors before you were left with the one true candidate. The point being that when there are lots of possible answers, most of the evidence you need goes into just locating the true hypothesis out of millions of possibilities - bringing it to your attention in the first place. The amount of evidence you need to judge between two or three plausible candidates is much smaller by comparison. So if you just jump ahead without evidence and promote one particular possibility to the focus of your attention, you're skipping over most of the work. Like, you live in a city where there are a million people, and there's a murder, and a detective says, well, we've got no evidence at all, so have we considered the possibility that Mortimer Snodgrass did it?"
>
> "Did he?" said Dumbledore.
>
> "No," said Harry. "But later it turns out that the murderer had black hair, and Mortimer has black hair, so everyone's like, ah, looks like Mortimer did it after all. So it's unfair to Mortimer for the police to promote him to their attention without having good reasons already in hand to suspect him. When there are lots of possibilities, most of the work goes into just locating the true answer - starting to pay attention to it. You don't need proof, or the sort of official evidence that scientists or courts demand, but you need some sort of hint, and that hint has to discriminate that particular possibility from the millions of others. Otherwise you can't just pluck the right answer out of thin air. You can't even pluck a possibility worth thinking about out of thin air. And there's got to be a million other things I could do besides carrying around my father's rock. Just because I'm ignorant about the universe doesn't mean that I'm unsure about how I should reason in the presence of my uncertainty. The laws for thinking with probabilities are no less iron than the laws that govern old-fashioned logic, and what you just did is not allowed." Harry paused. "Unless, of course, you have some hint you're not mentioning."
>
> "Ah," said Dumbledore. He tapped his cheek, looking thoughtful. "An interesting argument, certainly, but doesn't it break down at the point where you make an analogy between a million potential murderers only one of whom committed the murder, and taking one out of many possible courses of action, when many possible courses of action may all be wise? I do not say that carrying your father's rock is the one best possible course of action, only that it is wiser to do than not."

## Chapter 17: Locating the Hypothesis

## Chapter 18: Dominance Hierarchies

> "Well, he certainly seems to have backed us into a corner," Dumbledore said, smiling happily. "But Hogwarts does need an evil Potions Master, or it just wouldn't be a proper magical school, now would it? So how about if Professor Snape is only awful toward students in their fifth year and higher?"

## Chapter 19: Delayed Gratification

## Chapter 20: Bayes's Theorem

```
Preference Utilitarianism
```

> "What makes something right, if not your wanting it?"
>
> "Ah," Harry said, "preference utilitarianism."

Preference Utilitarianism is the ethical theory that the moral ideal is the one maximizing the preferences of the most people. 

## Chapter 21: Rationalization

> "This day shall mark the dawn of... the Bayesian Conspiracy."

## Chapter 22: The Scientific Method

```
Asch's Conformity Experiment
```

---

> Draco had heard of something called the Socratic Method, which was teaching by asking questions (named after an ancient philosopher who had been too smart to be a real Muggle and hence had been a disguised pureblood wizard). One of his tutors had used Socratic teaching a lot. It had been annoying but effective.
