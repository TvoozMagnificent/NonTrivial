# Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality

## Chapter 1: A Day of Very Low Probability

> Now his parents were getting into one of those arguments again, one where his mother tried to make his father feel guilty, and his father tried to make his mother feel stupid.

```
The Experimental Method
```
> If it's true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor here and see the magic for ourselves, and Dad will admit that it's true. And if not, then Mum will admit that it's false. That's what the experimental method is for, so that we don't have to resolve things just by arguing.

The Experimental Method, instead of presenting arguments, tests the truth of a statement by experimentation, usully comparing a test group (made with alterations) to a control group (made with no alterations or a placebo). 

## Chapter 2: Everything I Believe Is False

> Nothing about how magic doesn't work when people are sceptical of it, or anything like that.

## Chapter 3: Comparing Reality To Its Alternatives

```
The Bystander Effect
```

> Latane and Darley's experiment had shown that you were more likely to get help if you had an epileptic fit in front of one person than in front of three. Diffusion of responsibility, everyone hoping that someone else would go first.

The Bystander Effect refers to the effect that, when there are bystanders nearby, the diffusion of responsibility means nobody will step in. 

## Chapter 4

> World domination is such an ugly phrase. I prefer to call it world optimisation.

```
Fermi Estimation
```

> It's a mathematical thing. Named after Enrico Fermi. A way of getting rough numbers quickly in your head...
> 
> Twenty gold Galleons weighed a tenth of a kilogram, maybe? And gold was, what, ten thousand British pounds a kilogram? So a Galleon would be worth about fifty pounds... The mounds of gold coins looked to be about sixty coins high and twenty coins wide in either dimension of the base, and a mound was pyramidal, so it would be around one-third of the cube. Eight thousand Galleons per mound, roughly, and there were around five mounds of that size, so forty thousand Galleons or 2 million pounds sterling.

Fermi Estimation is a way to get rough numbers quickly by partitioning your estimation into steps. 

```
Logical vs. Emotion
```

> I cannot deny the sense of your words, though I much wish I could.

Sometimes, logic and emotion can go against each other. In such cases, we shall apply our rationale. 

```
Fundamental Attribution Error
```

> I suppose there's no chance that if I said fundamental attribution error you'd have any idea what that meant.

A fundamental attribution error is in which a permanent trait is given to a person due to one occurence that may also be (better) explained using circumstance or chance.
